# Robo Speaker
It is a voice synthesis application that aims to convert text input into natural-sounding speech. The project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies to generate human-like audio output from text data.

The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input text, select preferred voice characteristics, and generate high-quality audio output.
